/*
 Key Concept Clarification
ðŸ”¹ Reference (int& x)

    Not a pointer.

    It's like giving another name to the same variable.

    Cannot be null, cannot be reassigned.

    Compiler internally handles it like a pointer, but you use it like a normal variable.

ðŸ”¹ Pointer (int* x)

    Is a real pointer.

    You must dereference using * to access value.

    Can be null, can be reassigned to point elsewhere.
