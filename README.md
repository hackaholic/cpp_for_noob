# cpp_for_noob
Learning C++ from scratch, one concept at a time!
Goal: Understand, Practice, and Master â€” not just memorize.

ðŸ“– About This Repo

This repository is my personal notebook and playground while learning C++.
I believe in learning slowly, deeply, and with real understanding â€” not just rushing through syntax.

I'm starting from the basics and building up:

    OOP (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, etc.)

    Virtual Functions and VTables

    Smart Pointers

    Memory Management

    STL (Standard Template Library)

    Advanced Topics (Multithreading, Move Semantics, etc.)

Every file here represents a concept I learned, coded, and documented in my own words.

Why This Repo Exists

    To track my learning journey.

    To revisit anytime I feel stuck.

    To share with others who might also feel like "noobs" but want to learn deeply.

    No shame in being a beginner â€” the only mistake is quitting


Final Words

If you somehow found this repo â€”
Welcome!
Let's keep learning, keep building!
